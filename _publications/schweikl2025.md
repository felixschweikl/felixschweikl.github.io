This study evaluates the three modelling approaches Cumulative Odds Model, XGBoost and LSTM to forecast the global geomagnetic index Hp30 up to hours ahead, by applying a direct forecasing approach, which is provided by the forecastML R package. Therefore recently observed seasonal variations, solar wind data and Hp30 measurements are used as input data.
