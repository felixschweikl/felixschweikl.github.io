I am a statistician interested in geophysics. Currently I apply a time series analysis on a geomagnetic index to predict geomagnetic disturbances in Earth's magnetic field caused by solar activity.
During my studies in Statistics and Data Science at Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München, I completed a minor subject in Geophysics and later specialized in Machine Learning.
